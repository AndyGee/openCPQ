The talk presents the new open-source project openCPQ for the web-based configuration of complex products. In contrast to popular commercial configuration tools openCPQ
- uses the browser not only for the UI but also for the business logic, which makes configurators extremely fast by avoiding round trips to the server,
- supports modelling of configuration rules embedded in JavaScript, which permits user-defined abstractions in a flexible way, and
- recomputes the configuration result from scratch instead of incrementally propagating changes in the user input, which fits nicely with React’s architecture and makes openCPQ a light-weight framework.
